I was tasked with investigations of empirical asset pricing models during the periods overlapping the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In particular, the CAPM and Fama French asset pricing model is the subject of the investigations.
The sample include 05 stocks.
The solution shows:
1. The covarience matrix and summary statistics of stock returns during the sample period
2. portfolio valuation to show: (a) portfolio with the lowest risk, (b) portfolio with the highest return and (c) portfolio with the highest sharpe ratio.
3. Data points and the estimated regression line.
4. The empirical asset pricing models for the entire sample (portfolio), visualise the results
5. Validity of the asset pricing models for a single stocks and for the whole data sample
